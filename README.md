ExQuilla was originally developed by R Kent James. Due to retirement, ownership and responsibility has been taken over by Beonex GmbH.  

After R Kent abandoned it the new owner has decided to charge for maintaince work on the extension but I believe the old version is still perfectly usable in TB60. The extension will break in TB68 but there's no reason people can't stay on the older TB60 builds of Thunderbird and continue to use the extension.

I value that there is someone out there actively maintaining the extension for new versions of Thunderbird but if you are going to pay for it you are better off paying for their [Owl extension](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/owl-for-exchange/) which uses the new Thunderbird APIs and isn't in danger of the old API deprecation that is breaking Exquilla in the first place.

Original notice of discontinuation by R Kent follows

Extension for Thunderbird providing email and contact accounts using Exchange Web Services

This is the code for the current release of ExQuilla.

At this point in time, I do not intend to do any more releases. ExQuilla is now free of charge, and the code
is publically viewable here.

Issues may be added, but I am not following them up at this point in time. So while I may comment on them, most likely I will not.

Basically I have retired from this sort of programming due to a variety of reasons, including a serious medical issue.
It is still possible that the code of ExQuilla will be adopted by someone,
who will update it and then charge for additional updates. I believe this is in the best long-term interest of customers.

But for that reason, the code license is still "All Rights Reserved" rather than made into an open source license. That also means
that I am reluctant to accept pull requests, since that would complicate any future transfer of the code license to a third party.
