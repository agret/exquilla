# github fork
Original developer of the extension abandoned it, new owner has decided to charge for maintaince work on the extension but I believe it's still perfectly usable in TB60, although it will break in TB68 there's no reason people can't stay on the older TB60 builds of Thunderbird and continue to use the extension.

# exquilla
Extension for Thunderbird providing email and contact accounts using Exchange Web Services

This is the code for the current release of ExQuilla.

At this point in time, I do not intend to do any more releases. ExQuilla is now free of charge, and the code
is publically viewable here.

Issues may be added, but I am not following them up at this point in time. So while I may comment on them, most likely I will not.

Basically I have retired from this sort of programming due to a variety of reasons, including a serious medical issue.
It is still possible that the code of ExQuilla will be adopted by someone,
who will update it and then charge for additional updates. I believe this is in the best long-term interest of customers.

But for that reason, the code license is still "All Rights Reserved" rather than made into an open source license. That also means
that I am reluctant to accept pull requests, since that would complicate any future transfer of the code license to a third party.
